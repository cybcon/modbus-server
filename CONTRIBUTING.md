## How to contribute to Modbus Server

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in modbus-server**, and instead write me a mail to [info@oberdorf-itc.de](mailto:info@oberdorf-itc.de).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/cybcon/modbus-server/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/cybcon/modbus-server/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* All commits needs to have a valid GPG signature

* All pull request checks have to pass successfully

* If using 3rd party components, the licence needs to be compatible with the license of this project

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the application will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the new feature or the change. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
